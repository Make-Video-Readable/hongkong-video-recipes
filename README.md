Making Hong Kong Culinary YouTube accessible and "readable".

## Table of contents

* [Recipe Listing](listing.md)
* [Technical Notes and Details](tech.md)

## What?
Transcript, curate and summarise Hong Kong culinary YouTube videos in a more accessible and printer/e-reader friendly way.

## Why?
* Preserve the culinary culture of Hong Kong cuisine. Storing transcript verbal instruction can help to store these recipes in a more organised form.

* Also, this is meant for sharing to a broader spectrum of audiences. The curated recipes listed here are highly skilled cooks, however, due to the way they are filmed and present, they might be not universally accessible. 

Here listed some examples:

Issues | How does it affect the accessibility
-------|-------------------------------------
Background noises (such as hob, fans) | The elder audiences might find it distractive and might not hear the instruction clearly.
Low contrast caption colours | Audiences with visual impairments or with age-related eyesight problems might find it hard to read.
No Subtitles | Audiences with hearing impairments might find the video less meaningful.
